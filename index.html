        <p>
            I designed a random font using a website called Metaflop.
            I don't know what to call it. I'll keep it simple, MyFont.
            That's the name. The font leans more towards the abstract.
            It blurs the line between readability and symbolism. Some
            of the letters are wonky-looking. They have the shapes of
            stars. It's a clever font. You can use it on billboards,
            flyers, album covers, and more. MyFont reminds me of the
            1960s infomercials or the old cartoon show called The
            Jetsons. Overall, I believe this is a unique font you
            can use to obfuscate a message. The viewer must look
            deeper to find the hidden meaning.
